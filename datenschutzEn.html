            </h3>

            <p>
              If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal
              data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if
              special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1)
              DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal
              data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art.
              49 (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or
              to the access to information in your end device (e.g., via device
              fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25
              (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is
              required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the
              implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data
              on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is
              required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it
              on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data
              processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate
              interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the
              relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the
              following paragraphs of this privacy policy.

              companies that are not DPF-certified
            </h3>

            <p>
              We use, among other technologies, tools from companies located in
              third-party countries that are not safe under data protection law,
              as well as US tools whose providers are not certified under the
              EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF). If these tools are enabled,
              your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these
              countries. We would like you to note that no level of data
              protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in third
              countries that are insecure in terms of data protection law.
            </p>

            <p>
              We would like to point out that the US, as a secure third-party
              country, generally has a level of data protection comparable to
              that of the EU. Data transfer to the US is therefore permitted if
              the recipient is certified under the “EU-US Data Privacy
              Framework” (DPF) or has appropriate additional assurances.
              Information on transfers to third-party countries, including the
              data recipients, can be found in this Privacy Policy.

            <h3 class="font-bold">Recipients of personal data</h3>

            <p>
              In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various
              external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transfer
              of personal data to these external parties. We only disclose
              personal data to external parties if this is required as part of
              the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do
              so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a
              legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f)
              GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this
              data. When using processors, we only disclose personal data of our
              customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In
              the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is
              concluded.

              website. The Google Tag Manager itself does not create any user
              profiles, does not store cookies, and does not carry out any
              independent analyses. It only manages and runs the tools

              The Google Tag Manager is used on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
              The website operator has a legitimate interest in the quick and
              uncomplicated integration and administration of various tools on
              his website. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the

            <h3 class="font-bold">Google Analytics</h3>

            <p>
              This website uses functions of the web analysis service Google
              Analytics. The provider of this service is Google Ireland Limited
              (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
            </p>

            <p>
              Google Analytics enables the website operator to analyze the
              behavior patterns of website visitors. To that end, the website
              operator receives a variety of user data, such as pages accessed,
              time spent on the page, the utilized operating system and the
              user’s origin. This data is assigned to the respective end device
              of the user. An assignment to a user-ID does not take place.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, Google Analytics allows us to record your mouse and
              scroll movements and clicks, among other things. Google Analytics
              uses various modeling approaches to augment the collected data
              sets and uses machine learning technologies in data analysis.
            </p>

            <p>
              Google Analytics uses technologies that make the recognition of
              the user for the purpose of analyzing the user behavior patterns
              (e.g., cookies or device fingerprinting). The website use
              information recorded by Google is, as a rule transferred to a
              Google server in the United States, where it is stored.
            </p>

            <p>
              The use of these services occurs on the basis of your consent
              pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG. You may revoke
              your consent at any time.
            </p>

            <p>

            </h2>

            <h3 class="font-bold">Data processing</h3>

            <p>
              We use online conference tools, among other things, for
              communication with our customers. The tools we use are listed in
              detail below. If you communicate with us by video or audio
              conference using the Internet, your personal data will be
              collected and processed by the provider of the respective
              conference tool and by us.
            </p>

            <p>
              The conferencing tools collect all information that you
              provide/access to use the tools (email address and/or your phone
              number). Furthermore, the conference tools process the duration of
              the conference, start and end (time) of participation in the
              conference, number of participants and other “context information”
              related to the communication process (metadata).
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all the technical
              data required for the processing of the online communication. This
              includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs,
              device type, operating system type and version, client version,
              camera type, microphone or loudspeaker and the type of connection.
            </p>

            <p>
              Should content be exchanged, uploaded, or otherwise made available
              within the tool, it is also stored on the servers of the tool
              provider. Such content includes, but is not limited to, cloud
              recordings, chat/ instant messages, voicemail uploaded photos and
              videos, files, whiteboards, and other information shared while
              using the service.
            </p>

            <p>
              Please note that we do not have complete influence on the data
              processing procedures of the tools used. Our possibilities are
              largely determined by the corporate policy of the respective
              provider. Further information on data processing by the conference
              tools can be found in the data protection declarations of the
              tools used, and which we have listed below this text.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-bold">Purpose and legal bases</h3>

            <p>
              The conference tools are used to communicate with prospective or
              existing contractual partners or to offer certain services to our
              customers (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR). Furthermore, the use of the tools
              serves to generally simplify and accelerate communication with us
              or our company (legitimate interest in the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f)
              GDPR). Insofar as consent has been requested, the tools in
              question will be used on the basis of this consent; the consent
              may be revoked at any time with effect from that date.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-bold">Duration of storage</h3>

            <p>
              Data collected directly by us via the video and conference tools
              will be deleted from our systems immediately after you request us
              to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the reason for
              storing the data no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your
              end device until you delete them. Mandatory legal retention
              periods remain unaffected.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have no influence on the duration of storage of your data that
              is stored by the operators of the conference tools for their own
              purposes. For details, please directly contact the operators of
              the conference tools.
            </p>
